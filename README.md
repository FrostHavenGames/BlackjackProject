# BlackjackProject

## Overview
This application contains a basic game of Blackjack. The user can specify how many players they would like to play and set a name for each player. Each player starts out with $1000 and the game will continue until the user decides to quit or all players run out of money. If one player runs out of money but the other players still have money the game will continue without that player. Players are allowed to bet money each round. If a player gets a Blackjack he/she will receive 1.5 the bet amount. Good luck.
